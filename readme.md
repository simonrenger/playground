# Learn C++ again

This repository shall help me to refresh and train my C++ Basics and low level knowledge. It also shall provide a challenge to expand my knowledge in C++ and algorithms

## operators

- Operator precedence
- what operators



## primitive data types

- primitive data types
  - sizes
  - use cases
- value types
- primitive operator operations



## Bit Operations



- bit flags
- bit shifts
- bit maps
- bit array



## `const` & `constexpr`



- when to use `const`
- when to use `constexpr`



## data types



- initialization
  - move operation
  - copy construct
  - order of initiation
- struct vs class
- union
- inheritance



## pointers & references



## references



- difference between points and references
- when to use a pointer when to use a reference

### pointers

#### primitive pointer (raw)



- raw pointers
- basic heap management
  - new / delete
- casting:
  - up and down cast
- type erasure



#### smart pointer

- concept behind them
  - types of smart pointers
- implementations of a simple `unquie_ptr`
- implementation of a `shared_ptr`



## memory



- allocate memory stack
  - primitive global allocator
  - primitive allocator class
- allocate memory on the heap
  - primitive global allocator
  - primitive global allocator class
- types of heaps and allocation strategies
  - use cases in games
